Title: Feature-Based Landscape Analysis of Continuous and Constraint Optimization Problems
Description: Contains tools and features, which can be used for an exploratory landscape
    analysis of continuous optimization problems. Those are able to quantify rather complex
    properties of optimization problems, such as the global structure, separability, etc.
